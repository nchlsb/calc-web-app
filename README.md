# Early Calculus Web App: Visualizing the Change from Discrete to Continuous

This apps student visualize the change from discrete to continuous in derivatives and integrals.

## Derivatives

Users turn a scent line into a tangent line to visualize the difference quotient.

## Integral

Users change the width of rectangles under a curve to visualize the Riemann sum.

# Todo
- [ ] Replace delta x of 0 on slider with "infinatley close to 0" or "lim as x approches 0"
- [ ] Consider removing numbers if pure visuals will suffice
- [ ] Allow a little bit of grey (rect fill color) to show at min rect width
